#Scenario: We are playing a game, where we are fighting against a boss against a 
#time limit, hence, we want to maximise the damage dealt.
#We are considering two stats, critical rate, which defines the probability of a 
#critical strike,an attack can only be a normal strike or a critical strike.
#and anoother stat, critical damage which determines the damage increase resulting from a 
#critical strike, for example, if the normal strike does 200 dmg, and 
#critical damage was 50%, a critical strike would deal 300 dmg
#We are given 300 stat points, each stat point can be allocated to either 
#crit dmg or crit rate at a rate of:
#1 stat point for 1% of CD and 2 stat points for 1% of CR

#Question:What allocation yields the greatest damage increase?

#We going to try a simulation approach, where we assume an allocation and
#simulate a single hit, many times, then we average the damage dealt across
#all simulation and consider this the expected damage increase.
#We repeat this for each allocation and find which has the highest increase

nsim=100 
#defines number of simulations for each allocation, 
#the higher the number, the more accurate the results

nhits=1
#defines the number of hits per simulation

#repeating for 0% CR to 100%, and putting remaining stat points in CD

  #We test for CR between 0-100%

#and CR probability of being 1+CD, a bernoulli dist. with p=CR where instead of 0 and 1
#we have 1 and 1+CD, we go to basics and calculate mean using the expectation formula
